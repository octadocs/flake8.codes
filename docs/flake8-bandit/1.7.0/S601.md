title: Test for shell injection within Paramiko
---

Paramiko is a Python library designed to work with the SSH2 protocol for
secure (encrypted and authenticated) connections to remote machines. It
is intended to run commands on a remote host. These commands are run
within a shell on the target and are thus vulnerable to various shell
injection attacks. Bandit reports a MEDIUM issue when it detects the use
of Paramiko's "exec\_command" method advising the user to check inputs
are correctly sanitized.

  - Example

<!-- end list -->

```
>> Issue: Possible shell injection via Paramiko call, check inputs are
   properly sanitized.
   Severity: Medium   Confidence: Medium
   Location: ./examples/paramiko_injection.py:4
3    # this is not safe
4    paramiko.exec_command('something; really; unsafe')
5
```
