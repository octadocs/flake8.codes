title: Test for SSL use with no version specified
---

This plugin is part of a family of tests that detect the use of known
bad versions of SSL/TLS, please see `../plugins/ssl_with_bad_version`
for a complete discussion. Specifically, This plugin test scans for
specific methods in Python's native SSL/TLS support and the pyOpenSSL
module that configure the version of SSL/TLS protocol to use. These
methods are known to provide default value that maximize compatibility,
but permit use of the aforementioned broken protocol versions. A LOW
severity warning will be reported whenever this is detected.

**Config Options:**

This test shares the configuration provided for the standard
`../plugins/ssl_with_bad_version` test, please refer to its
documentation.
