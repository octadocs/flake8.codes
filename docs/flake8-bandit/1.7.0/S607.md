title: Test for starting a process with a partial path
---

Python possesses many mechanisms to invoke an external executable. If
the desired executable path is not fully qualified relative to the
filesystem root then this may present a potential security risk.

In POSIX environments, the <span class="title-ref">PATH</span>
environment variable is used to specify a set of standard locations that
will be searched for the first matching named executable. While
convenient, this behavior may allow a malicious actor to exert control
over a system. If they are able to adjust the contents of the
<span class="title-ref">PATH</span> variable, or manipulate the file
system, then a bogus executable may be discovered in place of the
desired one. This executable will be invoked with the user privileges of
the Python process that spawned it, potentially a highly privileged
user.

This test will scan the parameters of all configured Python methods,
looking for paths that do not start at the filesystem root, that is, do
not have a leading '/' character.

**Config Options:**

This plugin test shares a configuration with others in the same family,
namely <span class="title-ref">shell\_injection</span>. This
configuration is divided up into three sections,
<span class="title-ref">subprocess</span>,
<span class="title-ref">shell</span> and
<span class="title-ref">no\_shell</span>. They each list Python calls
that spawn subprocesses, invoke commands within a shell, or invoke
commands without a shell (by replacing the calling process)
respectively.

This test will scan parameters of all methods in all sections. Note that
methods are fully qualified and de-aliased prior to checking.

```yaml
shell_injection:
    # Start a process using the subprocess module, or one of its
    wrappers.
    subprocess:
        - subprocess.Popen
        - subprocess.call

    # Start a process with a function vulnerable to shell injection.
    shell:
        - os.system
        - os.popen
        - popen2.Popen3
        - popen2.Popen4
        - commands.getoutput
        - commands.getstatusoutput
    # Start a process with a function that is not vulnerable to shell
    injection.
    no_shell:
        - os.execl
        - os.execle
```
