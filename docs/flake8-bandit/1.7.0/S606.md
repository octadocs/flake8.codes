title: Test for starting a process with no shell
---

Python possesses many mechanisms to invoke an external executable.
However, doing so may present a security issue if appropriate care is
not taken to sanitize any user provided or variable input.

This plugin test is part of a family of tests built to check for process
spawning and warn appropriately. Specifically, this test looks for the
spawning of a subprocess in a way that doesn't use a shell. Although
this is generally safe, it maybe useful for penetration testing
workflows to track where external system calls are used. As such a LOW
severity message is generated.

**Config Options:**

This plugin test shares a configuration with others in the same family,
namely <span class="title-ref">shell\_injection</span>. This
configuration is divided up into three sections,
<span class="title-ref">subprocess</span>,
<span class="title-ref">shell</span> and
<span class="title-ref">no\_shell</span>. They each list Python calls
that spawn subprocesses, invoke commands within a shell, or invoke
commands without a shell (by replacing the calling process)
respectively.

This plugin specifically scans for methods listed in
<span class="title-ref">no\_shell</span> section.

```yaml
shell_injection:
    no_shell:
        - os.execl
        - os.execle
        - os.execlp
        - os.execlpe
        - os.execv
        - os.execve
        - os.execvp
        - os.execvpe
        - os.spawnl
        - os.spawnle
        - os.spawnlp
        - os.spawnlpe
        - os.spawnv
        - os.spawnve
        - os.spawnvp
        - os.spawnvpe
        - os.startfile
```
