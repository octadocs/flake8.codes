title: Test for use of hard-coded password argument defaults
---

The use of hard-coded passwords increases the possibility of password
guessing tremendously. This plugin test looks for all function
definitions that specify a default string literal for some argument. It
checks that the argument does not look like a password.

Variables are considered to look like a password if they have match any
one of:

  - "password"
  - "pass"
  - "passwd"
  - "pwd"
  - "secret"
  - "token"
  - "secrete"

Note: this can be noisy and may generate false positives.

**Config Options:**

None

  - Example

<!-- end list -->

```
>> Issue: [B107:hardcoded_password_default] Possible hardcoded
password: 'Admin'
   Severity: Low   Confidence: Medium
   Location: ./examples/hardcoded-passwords.py:1

1    def someFunction(user, password="Admin"):
2      print("Hi " + user)
```
