title: Test for use of hard-coded password strings
---

The use of hard-coded passwords increases the possibility of password
guessing tremendously. This plugin test looks for all string literals
and checks the following conditions:

  - assigned to a variable that looks like a password
  - assigned to a dict key that looks like a password
  - used in a comparison with a variable that looks like a password

Variables are considered to look like a password if they have match any
one of:

  - "password"
  - "pass"
  - "passwd"
  - "pwd"
  - "secret"
  - "token"
  - "secrete"

Note: this can be noisy and may generate false positives.

**Config Options:**

None

  - Example

<!-- end list -->

```
>> Issue: Possible hardcoded password '(root)'
   Severity: Low   Confidence: Low
   Location: ./examples/hardcoded-passwords.py:5
4 def someFunction2(password):
5     if password == "root":
6         print("OK, logged in")
```
