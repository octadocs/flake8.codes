title: Test for any function with shell equals true
---

Python possesses many mechanisms to invoke an external executable.
However, doing so may present a security issue if appropriate care is
not taken to sanitize any user provided or variable input.

This plugin test is part of a family of tests built to check for process
spawning and warn appropriately. Specifically, this plugin test
interrogates method calls for the presence of a keyword parameter
<span class="title-ref">shell</span> equalling true. It is related to
detection of shell injection issues and is intended to catch custom
wrappers to vulnerable methods that may have been created.

  - `../plugins/start_process_with_partial_path`

**Config Options:**

This plugin test shares a configuration with others in the same family,
namely <span class="title-ref">shell\_injection</span>. This
configuration is divided up into three sections,
<span class="title-ref">subprocess</span>,
<span class="title-ref">shell</span> and
<span class="title-ref">no\_shell</span>. They each list Python calls
that spawn subprocesses, invoke commands within a shell, or invoke
commands without a shell (by replacing the calling process)
respectively.

Specifically, this plugin excludes those functions listed under the
subprocess section, these methods are tested in a separate specific test
plugin and this exclusion prevents duplicate issue reporting.

```yaml
shell_injection:
    # Start a process using the subprocess module, or one of its
    wrappers.
    subprocess: [subprocess.Popen, subprocess.call,
                 subprocess.check_call, subprocess.check_output
                 execute_with_timeout]
```

  - Example

<!-- end list -->

```
>> Issue: Function call with shell=True parameter identified, possible
security issue.
   Severity: Medium   Confidence: High
   Location: ./examples/subprocess_shell.py:9
8 pop('/bin/gcc --version', shell=True)
9 Popen('/bin/gcc --version', shell=True)

```
