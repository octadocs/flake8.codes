title: Test for binding to all interfaces
---

Binding to all network interfaces can potentially open up a service to
traffic on unintended interfaces, that may not be properly documented or
secured. This plugin test looks for a string pattern "0.0.0.0" that may
indicate a hardcoded binding to all network interfaces.

  - Example

<!-- end list -->

```
>> Issue: Possible binding to all interfaces.
   Severity: Medium   Confidence: Medium
   Location: ./examples/binding.py:4
3   s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
4   s.bind(('0.0.0.0', 31137))
5   s.bind(('192.168.0.1', 8080))
```
