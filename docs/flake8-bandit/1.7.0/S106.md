title: Test for use of hard-coded password function arguments
---

The use of hard-coded passwords increases the possibility of password
guessing tremendously. This plugin test looks for all function calls
being passed a keyword argument that is a string literal. It checks that
the assigned local variable does not look like a password.

Variables are considered to look like a password if they have match any
one of:

  - "password"
  - "pass"
  - "passwd"
  - "pwd"
  - "secret"
  - "token"
  - "secrete"

Note: this can be noisy and may generate false positives.

**Config Options:**

None

  - Example

<!-- end list -->

```

   Severity: Low   Confidence: Medium
   Location: ./examples/hardcoded-passwords.py:16
