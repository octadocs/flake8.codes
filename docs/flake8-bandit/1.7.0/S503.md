title: Test for SSL use with bad defaults specified
---

This plugin is part of a family of tests that detect the use of known
bad versions of SSL/TLS, please see `../plugins/ssl_with_bad_version`
for a complete discussion. Specifically, this plugin test scans for
Python methods with default parameter values that specify the use of
broken SSL/TLS protocol versions. Currently, detection supports methods
using Python's native SSL/TLS support and the pyOpenSSL module. A MEDIUM
severity warning will be reported whenever known broken protocol
versions are detected.

**Config Options:**

This test shares the configuration provided for the standard
`../plugins/ssl_with_bad_version` test, please refer to its
documentation.
